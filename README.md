# Our Gallery

## Introduction

My Our Gallery project is a fun online gallery blog, it allows users to discus the art with eachother by leaving comments and liking the art pieces.

The admin of the site will be able to create new posts to show differnt pieces of art, they will be able to read what they have posted, upate the posts and delete them if and when nessasary. This shows the use of CRUD functionality in the project. The users will also be able to create, read, update and delete their comments making use of this functionality for both the users and admin of the site.

## User Stories

I used the GitHub projects board to log my user stories to help me manage my project. 
This helped me break the project down into smaller tasks that would be more manageable by moving them into the in progrss section whilst I focused on them. once a task was complete I could move it into the done section to help me see my progress.
